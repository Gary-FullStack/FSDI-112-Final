Final for FSDI 112

In my opinion the last two classes of 112 were disjoited and chaotic and not at all well planned.
The substitute teacher had to recreate the project from scratch as we watched for 20 minutes because 
he said that "his code" was not the same as what we had and therefore was not able to smoothly teach this class.


My ability to complete this project was, therefore, directly impacted.  

I spent more time outside class trying to figure this lesson out than I did IN class "learning" it.

I am submitting as is, and will accept with no argument, what ever scoring you assign.
